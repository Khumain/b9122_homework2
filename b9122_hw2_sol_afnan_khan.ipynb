       " 'Sustainable Development Goals Summit Must Deliver on Commitment Needed to Realize Promise of 2030 Agenda, Says Deputy Secretary-General, Briefing Member States': 'Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed’s remarks at the President of the General Assembly’s briefing to the Member States on the Sustainable Development Goals Summit, in New York today:It is a pleasure to be here with you this afternoon.\\xa0 In a few short days, we will be moving at full speed so it is great to be able to connect with you, hear your views and situate ourselves for another major high-level week.Across the SDG [Sustainable Development Goal] Summit, the Climate Ambition Summit, the Financing for Development Dialogue, the three key health meetings or next’ year’s Summit of the Future, we all have one clear goal:\\xa0 to secure greater momentum, strengthened solidarity and an ever-larger movement to keep the promise of the SDGs alive — for everyone, everywhere.For its part, the UN Secretariat and UN development system more broadly have been fully mobilized over recent months at all levels both here and in the field.\\xa0 We are confident that those efforts will bear fruit next week.\\xa0 As the PGA [President of the General Assembly] has just outlined, the SDG Summit is rightly the centrepiece.\\xa0 And it is encouraging to see some 80\\xa0world leaders ready to speak to their plans and commitments to lift the SDGs in the second half.We urge all countries to put those messages at the heart of their statements of the general debate — demonstrating the centrality of the SDGs in everything that we do beyond the summit.I also echo the words of the President in commending delegations for their incredible efforts to secure a clear-headed and forward-leaning political declaration.Its adoption next week will send a much needed and strong signal to the world:\\xa0 That the global goals remain a source of hope, unity and direction in a world of division and cascading crisis.\\xa0 And that the international community is intent on doing all it can together, especially in the area of financing, to maximize progress between now and\\xa02030.The SDG Action Weekend serves to build momentum as we go into in the SDG Summit and related events of the week — health, finance, climate, et cetera.\\xa0 It will provide opportunities in particular for the many pillars of the SDG movement to come together and register their contributions and commitments.The most recent programme was shared with delegations yesterday and further updates will be available on the SDG Summit website in the coming days.\\xa0 Allow me to provide a quick summary of what we have planned.Activities here on Saturday will focus on the theme of mobilization, where we expect some 5,000\\xa0people to come together from all corners of the globe and all walks of life.A high-level inspiring and energizing opening segment in the General Assembly Hall will set the tone for the week to come.\\xa0 It will provide a rallying call to civil society, youth and others with an emphasis on solidarity, determination and possibility.Over the course of the day, we will provide opportunities for stakeholders to outline their contributions to the SDG Summit and beyond.\\xa0 This includes civil society, the private sector, youth, women, scientists and local and regional governments — all of which must step up and forward with greater ambition and urgency.On Sunday, we will shift gears and zoom in on how we best support countries to accelerate implementation.\\xa0 It will begin with an opening plenary in the Economic and Social Council Chamber, including an engaging and insightful panel discussion that will underscore the urgency of the moment, the sense of what is possible and the imperative for collective action where we are determined to succeed.Participants will then move to events across 12\\xa0high-impact initiatives and special sessions on digital, gender and complex settings.\\xa0 The high-impact initiatives address both six key SDG transitions, the critical means of implementation and a key dimension of the cross-cutting priority of gender equality.Across these meetings, our intention is to demonstrate that transformative progress is both possible and already happening — and to generate additional leadership, support and momentum around them.\\xa0 This is also the objective of key convenings and moments that will take place throughout the week in the SDG Media Zone and the SDG Pavilion.I’m sure many of you will have noticed the Pavilion and art exhibition grow and evolve as you enter the UN premises each day.\\xa0 It seeks to ensure that the power of high-level week resonates much more widely across the world by bringing leaders across sectors for spirited dialogue and action. \\xa0And to inspire creativity and innovation.\\xa0 And together, with a wide-ranging branding effort across the campus, it serves as clear reminder of the ambition and the hope the world needs this week to make quantum leap for the SDGs.Across the SDG Action Weekend and much more, Member State engagement is also critical.\\xa0 It is encouraging to see many leaders and ministers already confirmed to participate in the SDG Action Weekend sessions.\\xa0 We strongly encourage all interested Member States to reach out to the SDG Action Weekend organizers and we will accommodate as best we can.We are also happy to see that Member States will be organizing over 40\\xa0side events over the weekend.It is essential that this Summit delivers the breakthroughs, commitment, solidarity and fresh momentum the world needs to realize the promise of the 2030\\xa0Agenda.\\xa0 Most important of all, however, we will leave with a to-do list for each and every country and partner and to which we must hold ourselves accountable.You can continue to count on the UN development system, especially our resident coordinators and country teams to work with your Governments and other key stakeholders at the country level to translate the momentum and commitments from next week into the progress we all want to see — for people and planet.I look forward to this discussion and any questions you may have.',\n",
       " 'Promise of Sustainable Development in Peril, Secretary-General Warns High-Level Political Forum, Urging Every Government to Strengthen Action, Make 2023 Count': 'Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, in New York today:In 2015, countries unanimously committed to the 2030\\xa0Agenda for Sustainable Development — an action plan to advance a world of peace, prosperity and dignity for all.Today, that promise is in peril.\\xa0 Halfway to the 2030\\xa0deadline the world is woefully off-track.\\xa0 The Sustainable Development Goals\\xa0(SDGs) Progress Report Special Edition paints a stark picture.It shows that progress on fully half of all SDG targets is weak and insufficient.\\xa0 That almost a third have stalled or gone into reverse.\\xa0 That emissions continue to rise.\\xa0 Gaping inequalities persist.\\xa0 Hunger is back to 2005\\xa0levels.\\xa0 Gender equality is 300\\xa0years away.\\xa0 And on our current course, almost 600 million people will still be mired in extreme poverty by\\xa02030.\\xa0 The COVID-19 pandemic, a burgeoning climate crisis, widespread conflict, and the consequences of the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine have hobbled fragile and limited progress.But, let’s be clear: \\xa0our world was off track well before these upheavals.\\xa0 Ambition, urgency and solidarity have been lacking. \\xa0So has finance.\\xa0 Many countries are facing a financial abyss.\\xa0 The annual SDG funding gap has risen from $2.5\\xa0trillion before the pandemic to an estimated $4.2\\xa0trillion.Promises made on official development assistance and climate finance are not promises kept. \\xa0Governments are drowning in debt — with developing countries facing sky-high borrowing costs.\\xa0 And 52\\xa0nations are in default or close to it — with no effective system of debt relief in sight.This is the high-level political forum.\\xa0 The world is crying out for high-level political action.\\xa0 Action to make the Sustainable Development Goals a reality — for everyone, everywhere.\\xa0 Without it, the 2030\\xa0promise is in danger of slipping away:\\xa0 Sowing disillusionment, mistrust and resentment, imperilling the planet, failing women and girls, and denying opportunity and hope for millions of people.In our dangerous and divided world, no country can afford such an outcome.\\xa0 It is in all our interests to choose a different path.\\xa0 The 2030\\xa0Agenda is that path.\\xa0 It is a route to bridging divides, restoring trust and building solidarity.\\xa0 I urge every country to make 2023\\xa0count.Lay the ground now for coordinated efforts to get the Sustainable Development Goals on track — by making the most of the Food Systems Summit Stocktaking, the Climate Ambition Summit, the three health meetings, the preparatory meeting for the Summit of the Future, the Group of 20\\xa0(G20), the Annual Meetings of the Bretton Woods Institutions, the twenty-eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\\xa0(COP28), and of course, above all, the SDG Summit.Specifically, I urge every Government to come to the SDG Summit with clear plans and pledges to strengthen action in their countries to\\xa02030.\\xa0 We need ambitious national commitments and interventions to reduce poverty and inequality by\\xa02027 and\\xa02030.\\xa0 And clear policies, investment plans and partnerships to drive progress across major SDG transitions.We also need the SDG Summit to re-energize civil society, businesses, and others to throw their weight behind the goals – strengthening the global movement to deliver.\\xa0 I welcome the engagement and moral voice of young people and civil society here this week.\\xa0And I urge you to continue to fight for the SDGs.\\xa0 Above all, we need the SDG Summit to send a clear message from world leaders through a strong political declaration.As the negotiations are now in the final days, I urge each and every delegation to show flexibility and ambition so that together we rise to meet the moment.\\xa0 We need a political declaration that renews and revitalizes the SDG promise;\\xa0 That lays a path for faster progress on key SDG transitions, from social protection and jobs, to energy, education and more.\\xa0And that sends a clear signal on finance: \\xa0by demanding urgent action to deliver the SDG Stimulus and by paving the way for much-needed reforms of the international financial architecture. \\xa0Why?\\xa0 Because finance is the fuel that will drive SDG progress.Yet, today’s international financial system is failing:\\xa0It is failing to provide developing countries with long-term, affordable finance for development and climate action.\\xa0And it is failing to provide those countries with a safety net in the face of shocks.I have called for a new Bretton Woods moment.\\xa0 And put forward a Policy Brief proposing how we can redesign the global financial architecture so that it operates as a global safety net for all countries and provides access to affordable long-term finance.At the same time, we can and must act now to provide immediate relief to developing and emerging economies.\\xa0 That is why I have proposed the SDG Stimulus of $500\\xa0billion per year for investments in sustainable development and climate action.\\xa0 We need a massive surge in finance, including through increasing the capital base of multilateral development banks.\\xa0 And through changing their business models so they leverage far more private finance at reasonable cost to developing countries.The SDG Stimulus also calls for action on debt — urging leaders to establish a timely and effective debt relief mechanism that supports payment suspensions, for countries facing severe shocks, longer lending terms and lower rates.\\xa0 And it calls for an expansion of contingency financing for countries in need, including through rechannelling special drawing rights including through multilateral development banks — the multiplier effect.\\xa0 This can all be achieved now — if there is sufficient political will.We need meaningful strides in the right direction by the end of\\xa02023.\\xa0 So, I am urging G20 countries to set a timeframe this year to establish a new debt resolution mechanism.\\xa0 And developed countries to honour their commitments on climate finance:\\xa0 Deliver the promised $100\\xa0billion this year, replenish the Green Climate Fund and double funding for adaptation.\\xa0 This cannot wait.Every one of our SDG goals demands that we accelerate climate action.\\xa0 The World Bank estimates that up to 130\\xa0million people could be pushed into poverty by 2030 because of rising temperatures.\\xa0 Already, now, today: \\xa0wildfire smoke is choking people across North America; lack of food is taking lives in the Horn of Africa; floods and hurricanes are destroying homes and wrecking livelihoods around the world.\\xa0 All this when temperatures have risen 1.1°C.\\xa0 Yet, current policies are taking us to an increase of 2.8°C.\\xa0 This is madness.But, it is not too late to change course.\\xa0 Limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5°C is possible if the world takes a quantum leap in climate action, together.\\xa0To achieve this, I have proposed a Climate Solidarity Pact — in which big emitters make extra efforts to cut emissions and wealthier countries support emerging economies to do so.And I have put forward an Acceleration Agenda to super-charge these efforts.\\xa0 This asks countries to accelerate their net zero timelines, in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances.This means developed countries committing to reach net zero as close as possible to\\xa02040 and emerging economies as close as possible to\\xa02050.\\xa0 And it asks them to take concrete steps to phase out fossil fuels, to deliver climate justice, and to accelerate a just transition and a renewables revolution.We must show that we are serious if we are to rebuild trust between nations.\\xa0 By the end of COP28, I count on all G20 leaders to have committed to ambitious new nationally determined contributions.\\xa0 And I urge all parties to ensure that COP28 operationalizes the loss-and-damage fund.We face a bleak picture with challenges at every turn.\\xa0 But, as we cross the halfway mark to\\xa02030, one overriding truth stands out in my mind:\\xa0 Change is possible.\\xa0 Backsliding is not inevitable.\\xa0 Poverty, pollution and gender inequality are not pre-ordained.\\xa0 They are trends that can be reversed, problems that can be solved, tragedies that can be averted, lives that can be saved.And together, we can deliver.\\xa0 Let’s make this year count.\\xa0 Let’s keep the promise.',\n",
       " '‘No Time to Lose’ for Closing Finance Divide, as Multifaceted Crisis Devastates World’s Poorest Countries, Secretary-General Tells Economic and Social Council Forum': 'Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the 2023\\xa0Economic and Social Council Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up, in New York today:Before I deliver my opening statement, I would like to say a few words about what’s going on in Sudan.I strongly condemn the outbreak of fighting that is taking place in Sudan, and appeal to the leaders of the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces to immediately cease hostilities, restore calm and begin a dialogue to resolve the crisis.The situation has already led to horrendous loss of life, including many civilians. \\xa0Any further escalation could be devastating for the country and the region. \\xa0I urge all those with influence over the situation to use it in the cause of peace; to support efforts to end the violence, restore order and return to the path of transition.The humanitarian situation in Sudan was already precarious and is now catastrophic. \\xa0I condemn the deaths and injuries to civilians and humanitarian workers and the targeting and looting of premises. I remind all parties of the need to respect international law, including ensuring the safety and security of all United Nations and associated personnel and humanitarian aid workers.I have spoken during the weekend with the two Sudanese leaders and I am actively engaging with the African Union, the Arab League and leaders across the region.\\xa0 I reaffirm that the United Nations stands with the people of Sudan at this very difficult time, with full support for their efforts to restore the democratic transition and build a peaceful, secure future.Now I will deliver my statement.The world is in crisis — a multidimensional crisis that is turbocharging inequalities, with a devastating impact on the poorest and most vulnerable.\\xa0 The 2030\\xa0Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals are turning into a mirage of what might have been, as communities and Governments struggle to meet immediate needs.\\xa0 The scars of the COVID-19 pandemic run deep in developing countries that suffered terrible losses in lives and livelihoods.The war in Ukraine is contributing to a global cost of living crisis.\\xa0 Climate disasters are becoming more frequent, deadly and expensive.\\xa0 One in three countries is at high risk of a fiscal crisis.\\xa0And more than 40\\xa0per\\xa0cent of people in extreme poverty live in countries afflicted by severe debt problems.These trends are deeply damaging to the poorest people and communities — but not to the richest.\\xa0 One recent report on inequality found that, since the pandemic, the richest 1\\xa0per\\xa0cent of people around the world have captured nearly twice as much new wealth as the rest of the world combined.Inequalities within some countries are regressing towards early twentieth century levels — to a time before women were allowed to vote and before widespread acceptance of the concept of social protection. \\xa0This shames us all.The 2023\\xa0Financing for Sustainable Development Report reveals a yawning finance divide that will quickly turn into a development deficit for many countries — and a crisis in global trust and solidarity.\\xa0 Inequality is already leading to social unrest at the local and national level, and rising tensions and risks at the global level.\\xa0 Delay will only make these problems worse, as the climate crisis gathers pace and inequalities continue to grow.\\xa0 We have no time to lose.This is the background to my proposal to Group of 20\\xa0(G20) countries for an Sustainable Development Goal\\xa0(SDG) Stimulus to scale up affordable long-term financing for all countries in need, by at least $500\\xa0billion a year.\\xa0 The SDG Stimulus has three main areas for action.First, it aims to boost liquidity for investments in the transformations we need to achieve the SDGs: \\xa0renewable energy, sustainable food systems, and the fourth industrial revolution.\\xa0All sources of financing must be scaled up, and multilateral development banks have an important role to play.Multilateral development banks should be able to transform their business models and accept a new approach to risk. \\xa0This includes massively leveraging their funds to attract greater flows of private finance into developing countries at reasonable costs.\\xa0As their shareholders, I urge you to do everything in your power to increase their capital bases, support a more efficient use of their balance sheets, and bring about better lending terms to substantially increase their investments.We must also broaden eligibility criteria for concessional finance so that it is available to vulnerable middle-income countries in need, as well as the least developed economies.\\xa0 Rich countries should meet their official development assistance\\xa0(ODA) commitments.Second, the SDG Stimulus aims to tackle the high cost of debt and rising risks of debt distress.\\xa0 I have called for an ambitious debt relief initiative that enables countries in distress to exchange short-term debt for longer-term instruments at lower interest rates.We also need mechanisms to incentivize private creditors to participate alongside official creditors in debt restructurings.\\xa0 We need to move innovative ideas — like debt-for-SDG swaps and disaster clauses that suspend payments in times of crisis — from the drawing board to the boardroom.The United Nations, as the only organization with universal membership, is ready to facilitate inclusive dialogue on sovereign debt, bringing together the discussions that are happening in different forums.Third, contingency financing must be expanded.\\xa0 Last year, the International Monetary Fund\\xa0(IMF) allocated $650\\xa0billion in Special Drawing Rights — the main global mechanism to boost liquidity during crises.\\xa0 Based on current quotas, developed countries received 26\\xa0times more than least developed countries, and 13\\xa0times more than all the countries of Africa combined.\\xa0 Something is fundamentally wrong with the rules and governance system that produced this outcome.Special Drawing Rights should be channelled to countries that need them, including through multilateral development banks.

Indigenous women, the keepers of so much rich heritage, often suffer the most.\\xa0 My message today is clear: \\xa0the United Nations stands with you.I welcome your focus this year on the intersection of human and planetary health, the climate crisis and the rights of Indigenous Peoples.\\xa0I salute indigenous movements across the world — often led by women and young people — for spearheading efforts to protect nature and preserve biodiversity.For thousands of years, Indigenous Peoples have pioneered sustainable land management and climate adaption.\\xa0 In the Sahel, ancient farming techniques are breathing life into the semi-arid region.\\xa0 Across the Amazon, indigenous agriculture has preserved and enhanced the richness of the rainforest’s ecology.\\xa0 And in the Himalayas, systems developed by Indigenous Peoples preserve soil, reduce erosion, conserve water and reduce disaster risks.But, Indigenous Peoples live on the front lines of the climate emergency.\\xa0 Last year, I travelled to Suriname and had the extraordinary privilege of visiting with the Kaliña peoples.\\xa0 I saw first hand how climate change is devastating their lands, destroying their way of life and threatening their very survival.Indigenous Peoples have done nothing to cause the climate crisis, but often face the worst and most immediate impacts.\\xa0 That is why we must speed up efforts to deliver climate justice and scale up finance and capacities for adaptation and loss and damage.At the same time, Indigenous Peoples hold many of the solutions to the climate crisis and are guardians of the world’s biodiversity.\\xa0 The so-called “green economy” is not a new concept for Indigenous Peoples.\\xa0 It is a way of life\\xa0— stretching back millennia. \\xa0We have so much to learn from their wisdom, knowledge, leadership, experience and example.Since the adoption of the landmark Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in\\xa02007, the United Nations has steadily broadened the participation of Indigenous Peoples in our work.\\xa0 The declaration has been utilized in courts and galvanized political action, including the development of national action plans.I welcome the strengthened participation of Indigenous Peoples through platforms established within United Nations processes, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\\xa0(UNFCCC).The report on Our Common Agenda calls for innovative approaches to advance the meaningful participation and leadership of those traditionally marginalized, including minority and Indigenous groups.\\xa0 This includes efforts to combat food insecurity and close the digital divide.The United Nations is committed to keep promoting the rights of Indigenous Peoples in policies and programming at all levels — and to amplify your voices.\\xa0 Let us learn from and embrace the experiences of Indigenous Peoples worldwide.\\xa0 Let us work together and walk hand in hand towards peace, sustainability and prosperity for all.\\xa0 I wish all of you a very successful Forum.',\n",
       " 'Resident Coordinator System ‘Anchor for All Efforts to Help Countries in Achieving 2030 Agenda’, Secretary-General Tells Operational Activities Segment': 'Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the Economic and Social Council’s operational activities for development segment, in New York today:Halfway through the timeline of the 2030 Agenda, we are leaving more than half the world behind.Poverty and hunger are again growing.\\xa0 The climate crisis is escalating.\\xa0 Conflict and persecution have forced 100\\xa0million people from their homes.\\xa0 And the economic destruction and dislocation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic was prolonged and amplified by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.The cost of food, energy and finance has risen sharply, with a devastating impact on vulnerable countries and communities.\\xa0 Inequalities and gender discrimination are on the rise.The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — our only comprehensive solution to these crises — are far off track.We have gone into reverse on more than 30\\xa0per cent of SDG targets — including our most fundamental goals of reducing poverty and hunger.\\xa0 Progress on another 50\\xa0per cent is weak and insufficient.\\xa0 But it is not too late to turn the tide. \\xa0And we are determined to do just that.The SDG Stimulus, the proposed reforms of the global financial architecture, the Acceleration Agenda on climate, the Transforming Education Summit, Food Systems transformation, the Global Digital Compact, the Global Accelerator on Social Protection and Jobs, the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the memorandum of understanding on promoting Russian food and fertilizers to global markets – all these initiatives are aimed at reducing poverty, inequality and hunger, and getting the 2030 Agenda back on course.Around the world, United Nations country teams lead our efforts for sustainable, inclusive development.\\xa0 They are our eyes, ears and hands, supporting Governments, convening stakeholders, and striving to translate global and regional commitments on the SDGs into action.When we started the reform process, no one foresaw that our country teams would be operating in such challenging conditions.Despite that, four years on, the reforms have succeeded.\\xa0 My report on the quadrennial comprehensive policy review implementation demonstrates that.The verdict is in: \\xa0resident coordinators are bringing United Nations entities together in support of countries’ priorities for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.They are also working together to help address crises that cross borders.The overwhelming majority of host Governments agree.Fully 88\\xa0per cent say that resident coordinators provide effective and strategic leadership in support of their national plans and priorities.All least developed countries and landlocked developing countries surveyed said the United Nations activities were closely aligned with their needs and priorities.And all small island developing States said collaboration between UN entities has improved since the reforms.The system is data-driven — which is delivering new levels of transparency and accountability.In Egypt, the reinvigorated role of the resident coordinator was a catalyst to mobilize United Nations expertise and comprehensive action to support the Egyptian Presidency of the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties on the climate crisis.In Pakistan, the newly empowered resident coordinator system coordinated across the entire United Nations family with the Government, in response to the devastating floods that affected 33\\xa0million people.The Cooperation Framework was the blueprint for a long-term approach to support recovery, going beyond the immediate humanitarian response to involve international financial institutions.In small island developing States, the integrated support provided by our multi-country offices is helping to address issues ranging from climate adaptation to debt distress.The transformative vision of the 2030 Agenda relies on a global partnership and unprecedented investment.\\xa0 But that investment has not been forthcoming.Many developing countries simply cannot afford to invest in the SDGs because they face a financing abyss.\\xa0 The annual SDG funding gap stood at $2.5\\xa0trillion before the COVID-19 pandemic. \\xa0According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), it now stands at some 4.2\\xa0trillion.Developed countries adopted expansionary fiscal and monetary policies and have now largely returned to their pre-pandemic trajectory of economic growth.Developing countries have been hobbled by their inability to do the same. \\xa0Vulnerable middle-income countries are denied debt relief and concessional financing; and the Common Framework for Debt Treatment is not yet effectively working. \\xa0If they go to the markets, developing countries may be charged interest rates up to eight times higher than their developed counterparts.It is clear that something is seriously wrong with the rules and governance structures that produce these results.I have therefore called for an SDG Stimulus — an emergency measure to scale up affordable long-term financing for all countries in need, by at least $500\\xa0billion a year.At the same time, we are working on long-term proposals to right the fundamental injustices and inequalities in global financial architecture which reflect the global realities of 78\\xa0years ago.I count on your support for these proposals, and for all our efforts to accelerate the 2030 Agenda.Meanwhile, we rely on our partnerships with the Governments of developing countries to get the most out of every development dollar.\\xa0 And to do that, we need adequate, predictable and flexible funding for the United Nations development system.I thank those Members that have maintained or increased their financial support to the United Nations development system.\\xa0 However, the resident coordinator system is still chronically underfunded.\\xa0 We are far from reaching the targets we committed to four years ago.The resident coordinator system is the anchor for all our efforts to support countries in achieving the 2030 Agenda.\\xa0 Yet, in 2022, the resident coordinator system suffered from a funding gap of $85\\xa0million.\\xa0 The Joint SDG Fund is far short of the Funding Compact target of $290\\xa0million per year.Unless Member States step up, we are effectively starving the United Nations development system of the support it needs to deliver for Member States.A recruitment freeze is reducing our ability to deliver. \\xa0With every month that passes, further reductions will have to be made, affecting our ability to coordinate the United Nations system and convene beyond it.We have responded to the concerns of Member States. \\xa0We are now turning to Member States to meet their commitments.Let us recall we are talking about $85\\xa0million — a tiny investment for the returns we are already witnessing.Development coordination saves lives by eradicating poverty and preventing humanitarian crises.Countries are spending more than $2\\xa0trillion a year on military budgets.It is simply not credible to pledge support for peace, if they are not prepared to invest a tiny fraction of this amount in sustainable development\\xa0— the greatest conflict prevention tool we have.I therefore urge Member States to reconsider my recommendation for a hybrid 2.0 funding model for the United Nations development system.The current funding model for the resident coordinator system is far too vulnerable to fluctuations in voluntary funding, making it unpredictable and unsustainable.It has also failed to provide sufficient resources.The most logical, principled solution is to fund the resident coordinator system with a greater share of assessed contributions under the regular budget of the United Nations.Therefore, in the coming months, I intend to launch a transparent, inclusive consultation process with Member States so that all views are heard before a formal proposal is submitted to the General Assembly.I ask you to approach these consultations with a sense of urgency, solidarity and resolve.We must address this unfinished business from the reforms as we head towards the SDG summit in September.Creative new approaches have not worked.\\xa0 A new funding model, with a greater share of assessed contributions through the regular budget, is the only sustainable, predictable, and realistic option.Together, the United Nations and countries around the world are working towards a generational shift in global development — a shift towards fairness and justice in development financing, and a dynamic in-country support system that is aligned with the needs and priorities of Member States.The SDG Summit in September must be a moment of unity to provide a renewed impetus and accelerated action for achieving the SDGs.It must deliver concrete progress on the means of implementation and a clear commitment to overhaul the current international financial architecture.The next weeks and months are an important opportunity to prepare the ground.\\xa0 This will be the most important initiative of the 2023 calendar.We have made significant progress, but we still have a way to go.\\xa0 Member States are our partners on this journey. \\xa0We count on your continued engagement and leadership at the highest levels.A robust resolution from the Economic and Social Council operational activities for development segment would be an important first step in this direction.Together, we can create a more sustainable and equitable future for all people, everywhere.',\n",
       " 'Deputy Secretary-General, Briefing Members States before Economic and Social Council Segment, Highlights Resident Coordinator System’s Key Role in Advancing 2030 Agenda': 'Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, at the informal briefing for Member States ahead of the Economic and Social Council Segment on Operational Activities for Development, today:I am grateful, Mr. Vice-President, for the opportunity to engage informally with Member States on the upcoming Operational Activities Segment of the Economic and Social Council.\\xa0 We also thank you for your leadership efforts to ensure a successful Segment — your personal engagement in its preparations and the ambition you are imprinting are an inspiration to myself and my team.\\xa0 The Secretary-General and I are looking forward to the Segment.Given the heavy burden of work, we hope delegations have had an opportunity to go through the reports we have shared ahead of the Segment: \\xa0The Secretary-General’s report on the implementation of the QCPR [quadrennial comprehensive policy review]; and my report — as Chair of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group — on the Development Coordination Office and Resident Coordinator System.As we approach the Segment, we must take a step back and look at the context in which we meet.\\xa0 These are no ordinary times.\\xa0 The world is at an inflection point.\\xa0 Challenges are mounting every day.\\xa0 Poverty and hunger are at an all-time high. Climate emergencies are knocking on all our doors.\\xa0 Conflicts and humanitarian needs are rising at a faster scale than anything we have seen before.Yet, we know what the solution is: \\xa0sustainable, inclusive development.\\xa0 It is the only way to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities.\\xa0To address mistrust and vulnerabilities.\\xa0To prevent conflict and crises.\\xa0 Yet, we are far from achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and sustainable development remains chronically under-funded.It is, however, not too late to change course.\\xa0 The SDG Summit later this year provides a unique opportunity to pivot.\\xa0 We now have a clear picture of what is needed to get there.\\xa0 Moving from Goal-by-Goal efforts to focusing on key transitions will allow countries to accelerate — climate action, energy, food, education, jobs and social protection and digital connectivity. \\xa0This approach underscores the importance of an integrated agenda for sustainable development. \\xa0And by paying much more attention to means of implementation, these will be the pathways to success.The repositioned United Nations system, now fit for purpose, is delivering results.\\xa0 In launching these reforms, the Secretary-General knew that achieving the SDGs would require a very different United Nations development system.\\xa0 And that is also why he has worked hand-in-hand with Member States to reposition development at the heart of the United Nations.\\xa0He anticipated that the ability of the United Nations development system to translate global commitments on the ground would be more essential than ever.\\xa0 The system is also transforming, at an increasingly rapid pace, to respond with the skillsets and at the scale required to help implement the SDGs.The reports you have in front of you are a testament to that.\\xa0Multiple data sources and independent evaluations have come repeatedly to the same conclusion: \\xa0Under the leadership of Resident Coordinators, United Nations country teams are delivering better support to countries’ needs and priorities.Just to mention a few:\\xa0 94\\xa0per\\xa0cent of host Governments agreed that the United Nations Country Team activities adequately reflected the content of the Cooperation Framework (and therefore national priorities).\\xa0 Almost 80 per cent agreed that United Nations country teams were more focused on common results than before the reforms.\\xa0 Eighty-eight\\xa0per\\xa0cent have reported that Resident Coordinators provide effective and strategic leadership in support of national plans and priorities.\\xa0 Eighty-seven\\xa0per\\xa0cent agree that Resident Coordinators are now a more effective entry point to United Nations country support.The Secretary-General and I were particularly humbled by the fact that countries in special situations reported very favourably on the progress made thanks to the reform process.\\xa0 All least developed countries and landlocked developing countries surveyed considered that United Nations activities were closely aligned with their needs and priorities.All small island developing States agreed that United Nations entities were working more collaboratively than before the reforms — clearly the strengthening of multi-country offices has been key.\\xa0 And it was the input and the alignment of the Member States that ensured that we got the ambitions of those expectations.To give a sense of progress: \\xa0In 2019, when we transitioned to a new system, 70\\xa0per\\xa0cent of the small island developing States were satisfied with the alignment of United Nations system support. \\xa0This proportion has improved to 84\\xa0per\\xa0cent in 2021 and to 95\\xa0per\\xa0cent in 2022.We hope the upcoming Economic and Social Council Segment will provide you with ample opportunities to see tangible and compelling results achieved by our principals in the United Nations Sustainable Development Group and country teams around the globe.We see many developments that give us hope.\\xa0 At the country level, the United Nations development system is sharpening its ability to offer integrated policy advice and connect expertise across the system — including non-resident agencies — for specific country needs and priorities.We have come a long way — from resolutions; to the implementation of the mechanics of the reforms (the Management and Accountability Frameworks, dual lines); to the emergence of a new generation of United Nations country teams. \\xa0Increasingly, Resident Coordinators are becoming the centre of gravity of our ability to convene partners, to help countries mobilize the necessary means of implementation — including financing for the SDGs.\\xa0 Ninety-seven\\xa0per\\xa0cent of host Governments agreed that United Nations country teams engage meaningfully with international financial institutions, an increase from 90\\xa0per\\xa0cent in 2021.Another exciting trend is that the United Nations development system is visibly coalescing around the key transitions need for the SDGs.\\xa0117 countries have developed national pathways to sustainable food systems, as a follow-up to the 2021 Food System Summit.\\xa0 Energy Compacts grew from $400\\xa0billion to $600\\xa0billion to finance clean energy.The United Nations country teams and Resident Coordinators provided crucial support ahead of the 2022 Transforming Education Summit and pursue their work with countries as they shape their response.\\xa0 Sustainable pipelines are also being developed, enabling investments to flow.At the regional level, Regional Collaborative Platforms have gathered traction as a means to support United Nations country teams in delivering an integrated response and addressing cross-border development issues.\\xa0 Between February and April, as Chair of the five Regional Collaborative Platforms, I engaged with all United Nations regional directors across regions to continue to emphasize the importance of deploying our regional assets to better respond to country-level needs and strengthen vertical integration and alignments in key areas.\\xa0 This year will be a litmus test for the regional architecture.At the global level, our United Nations Sustainable Development Group has stepped up to treat development as an emergency — as we advanced the Secretary-General’s proposals to revamp the international financing architecture; or as we responded, through the Secretary-Generals Global Crises Response Group, to the food and energy crisis resulting from the conflict in Ukraine.We continued to make strides in efficiencies.\\xa0 In 2022, United Nations entities generated $405\\xa0million in efficiency gains — an increase of 47\\xa0per\\xa0cent from 2021. \\xa0This is a landmark in our repositioning journey.\\xa0We are also delivering on our commitment to strengthen transparency and accountability.\\xa0 For the first time, results achieved in 2022 through the RC system are also reported through the revised multi-annual Resident Coordinator system results framework.Early this year, I shared with the governing bodies a reform checklist as an oversight tool to help ensure a harmonized approach across all United Nations development system entities and adherence to the reforms.\\xa0 I encourage governing bodies and Heads of Entities to make full use of the checklist and to provide regular updates at the Operational Activities Segment.I am aware some of you may be concerned whether the reports are showing an overly “rosy” picture.\\xa0 My response is that, overall, they are — because the progress is real.\\xa0 In these reports, we let the data speak.\\xa0 We encourage each and every one of you to also forge your own assessment — consult your capitals or embassies who work closer to the collaboration at the country level.Our goal is to have access to as much data and feedback as feasible. \\xa0It helps us adjust, improve and maximize the impacts of the reforms to your expectations.\\xa0But our reports are also very clear on the areas where performance is below expectation, which require more attention.Many issues remain, as we should expect in any large-scale reform process — from uneven behavioural change across the system, through a mixed picture in the derivation of Cooperation Frameworks into country programmes of United Nations entities, to insufficient progress in the Funding Compact.\\xa0 You can count on the Secretary-General and me to continue to work with United Nations Principals — relentlessly — to address all issues as they surface.We count on your leadership to identify opportunities in intergovernmental processes or beyond that can continue to send the right incentives to accelerate our transformation even further.Funding remains a make-or-break.\\xa0 Member States and United Nations entities have made progress towards achieving important commitments in the Funding Compact.\\xa0 But progress has been mixed and unable to reach the demands.\\xa0For the first time, core funding exceeded the target of 30\\xa0per\\xa0cent.But looking closer, the increase is largely linked to specific investments — for example in the World Health Organization (WHO) during the pandemic.\\xa0Meanwhile, while overall pooled funding has increased and even surpassed our target of 10\\xa0per\\xa0cent. \\xa0Concerningly, the Joint SDG Fund — our flagship instrument for SDG transformation — falls well short of the Funding Compact target of $290\\xa0million per year.Despite significant efforts by the Secretary-General, entities across the United Nations system and many Member States — who went above and beyond — the Resident Coordinator System remains chronically under-funded.\\xa0In 2022, the funding gap of voluntary contributions was $85\\xa0million.We all know this is not viable.\\xa0 It jeopardizes hard-won gains and our ability to help countries in this critical mid-point of the SDGs, seven years before the 2030 deadline.\\xa0 The report highlights key areas where the Development Coordination Office had to begin scaling back in 2022 with implications for our activities. \\xa0Continuing into 2023, a persisting funding gap would increasingly affect our ability to deliver on the ground.The time has come for a definite solution.\\xa0 If we agree that achieving the 2030\\xa0Agenda matters and that development coordination is essential, then we must respond with resolve.\\xa0 All indicators show that the reforms are working.\\xa0 Many thought we would fail. \\xa0But working in partnership, we have succeeded.\\xa0 The new Resident Coordinator system is a reality and it is delivering on its promises.\\xa0De-investing at this point in time would be a disaster.As he announced in his report, the Secretary-General intends to request the General Assembly in a dedicated report, in the second half of the year, to re-consider the option for a hybrid 2.0 funding model for the Resident Coordinator system.\\xa0 The exact format and timing of this report will depend on the transparent and inclusive consultations that we will hold with Member States and reactions by the Economic and Social Council in the upcoming Segment.I know some of you had expected “more creativity” in the funding model.\\xa0 But we need to be fair.\\xa0 The Resident Coordinator system funding model is already the most “creative” across all entities of the United Nations.We now rely on complex and highly innovative funding components, and we remain vulnerable to fluctuations in voluntary funding.\\xa0 This is a core function for development. \\xa0It is the foundation on which all the rest relies on billions of investments in development entities to deliver coherently on the SDGs.The reinvigorated Resident Coordinator system allows for a minimum core capacity, universally, to address basic coordination needs to enable wider United Nations country team action at greater scale to help countries implement the SDGs.\\xa0 Yet, it is flexible enough to ensure each Resident Coordinator Office is able to adapt to specific country issues via other sources (agency secondees; humanitarian staffers via the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs; peace advisors, inter alia).There is no one size fits all.\\xa0 We hope we can hear your insights and reactions we head to the Economic and Social Council Segment.\\xa0 We have only one ask.\\xa0 Please protect the same sense of partnership and ambition that has fuelled these reforms from day one.I see many experts in this room.\\xa0 I know how hard your job can be.\\xa0 Balancing capital considerations and big-picture geopolitical issues with the realities of these basements.\\xa0 It is only with your leadership, experience and support that we can move ahead.\\xa0While complex, the process ahead is also full of opportunities, and we trust we can count on constructive and active engagement by all.\\xa0My team and I will always have our doors open for you to bring the latest feedback from the field to inform your decision-making.But the current situation requires a sense of urgency — we can no longer afford to move from review to review without a solution.\\xa0 It is time for an agreement — ultimately, we will live, albeit on life support, with whatever decision you make, in your collective wisdom.Let us look ahead. \\xa0Towards 2030 and the world we want.\\xa0 The Secretary-General and I stand ready to work with you to offer the best possible support to countries.\\xa0 Together, we can achieve the 2030\\xa0Agenda.\\xa0 This is what is at stake.\\xa0 Let us bear it in mind.',\n",
